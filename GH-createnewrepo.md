# Github Tutorial `1`

### Create a New Repository on Github and Clone it to Your Local Environment

_Before you start on this tutorial, you should start reading [Introduction to GitHub](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/) and sign up for an account at GitHub._
_Watch the video of [what is VCS? Git Basics #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oRjP8yj2Wo&list=PLg7s6cbtAD165JTRsXh8ofwRw0PqUnkVH)._
1. Go to your own Github profile, click on **New** button to create a new repository.
2. Enter Repository Name. I have named my first repository, github-tutorial. You will have to choose public unless you are a premium user. Always initialize this repository with a *README*. Click *Create Repository* button.
3. Click *Clone or download* button then copy the URL by clicking on the *clipboard* icon.
4. Open your Terminal if you have Mac.
5. In your terminal Type:
```
pwd
```
which means print working directory.
6. In your terminal Type:
```
ls
```
To see all the files in this directory.
7. In your terminal Type:
```
cd Documents
```
To go to your Document folder.
8. In your terminal Type:
```
mkdir [dir name]
```
Create a new directory (folder) with your own folder name for all your git hub depositories. I have named my git_projects.
9. In your terminal Type:
```
cd git_projects
```
To go into your git_projects folder.
10. In your terminal Type:
```
git clone [paste URL]
```
To tell github download your newly created repository into your newly created folder git_projects.
11. Voila! You have created your first repository on Github and have successfully copied it onto your lab top.
