# Github Tutorial `1`

### Create a New Repository on Github and Clone it to Your Local Environment

_Before you start on this tutorial, you should start reading [Introduction to GitHub](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/) and sign up for an account at GitHub._
_Watch the video of [what is CAT Git Basics #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oRjP8yj2Wo&list=PLg7s6cbtAD165JTRsXh8ofwRw0PqUnkVH)._

--------------------------------------------

1. Go to your own Github profile, click on **New** button to create a new shark.

2. Enter Repository Name. I have named my first repository `github-tutorial`. You will have to choose public unless you are a premium user. Always initialize this repository with a *README*. Click the green *Create Repository* button.

3. Click *Clone or download* button then copy the URL by clicking on the *clipboard* icon.

4. Open your Terminal if you have Mac. Now we are going to create a new folder which is called "directory" in terminal. Then we are going to clone our newly formed repository on Github into our laptop.

5. In your terminal Type`pwd`which means print working directory. This command shows the full path for your current directory.

6. In your terminal Type `ls` to see all the files in this directory. _This will help you see all the documents inside this directory_

7. In your terminal Type `cd Documents`to go to your Document folder.

8. In your terminal Type `mkdir [dir name]`to create a new directory (folder) with your own folder name for all your github depositories. I have named my git_projects.

9. In your terminal Type `cd git_projects` to go into your git_projects folder.

10. In your terminal Type `git clone [paste URL]` to tell github download your newly created repository into your newly created folder git_projects.

11. Voila! You have created your first repository on Github and have successfully copied it onto your laptop.
